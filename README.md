2. Change directory `cd tapNrun`

2. Alternatively tests can be ran in Terminal using Karma `npm test`

### Code coverage

2. Install necessary dependencies `npm install`
3. Start Karma - tests will show in terminal, a window will open in Google Chrome `karma start`
4. Press control-c to close the tests within terminal `ctrl-c`
